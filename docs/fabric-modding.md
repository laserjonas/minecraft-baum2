# Fabric Modding Reference — Minecraft 1.21.11

Living reference for Minecraft 1.21.11 / Fabric Loader / Fabric API / Fabric Loom / Yarn /
Mixin facts relevant to this project. Maintained by the `fabric-docs-researcher` agent (see
`.claude/agents/fabric-docs-researcher.md`) — both contributors should consult it before
guessing at an API, and ask the agent (not just search blindly) whenever something modding-
related is unclear. See `CLAUDE.md` for the rule.

Append new findings under the relevant section. Don't delete verified entries just because
they look obvious in hindsight — they're here so nobody re-derives them a second time.

## Project's pinned versions

- Minecraft: `1.21.11`
- Yarn mappings: `1.21.11+build.6`
- Fabric Loader: `0.19.3`

- Fabric Loom: `1.17.13`
- Java target: `21`

## Version / mapping gotchas

- **Minecraft 26.2 has no Yarn mappings yet.** 26.2 is the actual latest stable Minecraft
  release (Mojang's year.release versioning), but as of project setup, the Yarn mappings
  project had not published mappings for it — `https://meta.fabricmc.net/v2/versions/yarn/26.2`
  returned an empty array. Building against `minecraft_version=26.2` with
  `yarn_mappings=1.21.11+build.6` fails with `IllegalArgumentException: Could not find
  namespace "official" in provided tiny tree` during source remapping — the mappings simply
  don't match the game version. Fix: use the newest Minecraft version that *does* have
  published Yarn mappings (currently 1.21.11), and revisit once Yarn catches up. Check
  `https://meta.fabricmc.net/v2/versions/yarn/<version>` before bumping `minecraft_version`.
- **Fabric API artifact versions are per-Minecraft-version**, not global — check
  `https://maven.fabricmc.net/net/fabricmc/fabric-api/fabric-api/maven-metadata.xml` for the
  exact `+<mc_version>` suffix. For 1.21.11 the last/highest is `0.141.4+1.21.11`; after that
  the project moved to the `26.x` version line.
- **Fabric Loom `1.17-SNAPSHOT` is a floating version** — it resolved to a timestamped
  snapshot build (jar version `1.17.13` at time of writing) rather than a fixed release. Pin
  the actual stable release (`1.17.13`) instead of tracking `-SNAPSHOT`, for build
  reproducibility.
- **Loom 1.17.13 requires Gradle's plugin `api-version` >= 9.5.0.** Gradle 9.2.1 fails to
  resolve the plugin variant at all ("No matching variant of net.fabricmc:fabric-loom...").
  Use Gradle 9.5.1+ in `gradle-wrapper.properties`.

## Gradle / Loom

- `./gradlew genSources` (or `gradlew.bat genSources` on Windows) decompiles Minecraft +
  Fabric API sources — the most authoritative reference for exact method signatures on this
  version, more reliable than any wiki page for a brand-new Minecraft release.
- `def targetJavaVersion` in `build.gradle`: setting `toolchain.languageVersion` only when
  `JavaVersion.current() < javaVersion` means Loom's `runClient`/`runServer` `JavaExec` tasks
  can silently pick up a different, higher-versioned JDK auto-detected on the machine (e.g. a
  stray IDE-managed JDK 25) instead of the pinned target. Pin `toolchain.languageVersion`
  **unconditionally** to defend against this — see `build.gradle` history (`2405ca7`).
- Mixin config `compatibilityLevel` (in `*.mixins.json`) must match the actual toolchain
  Java version (`JAVA_21` for this project), not whatever an IDE mixin-config generator
  defaulted to locally — mismatches here can cause confusing runtime failures.

## Mixins

_(Fischey is actively working with Mixins on `fischey_workbranch` — e.g. redirecting
`ExperienceOrbEntity.spawn` to block vanilla XP drops. Add SpongePowered Mixin API findings
here as they come up: `@Inject`, `@Redirect`, `@ModifyVariable`, shadow fields, etc.)_

## Registries

_(Nothing registered yet beyond the mod itself — add `Registry`/`Registries` API findings
here once `registry/ModItems` etc. exist.)_

## Events (Fabric API)

- `ServerPlayConnectionEvents.JOIN` / `.DISCONNECT` — used in
  `events/LevelUpHandler.java` to track a player's last-known level across sessions.
- `ServerLivingEntityEvents.AFTER_DEATH` — used in `events/MobDeathHandler.java` to grant XP
  when a `HostileEntity` dies to a `ServerPlayerEntity` attacker.
- `CommandRegistrationCallback.EVENT` — used in `commands/Baum2Commands.java` to register the
  `/baum2` command tree via Brigadier.

## Rendering / HUD

- `HudRenderCallback.EVENT` (client-side) was used for a custom XP HUD overlay
  (`ui/ProgressionHud.java`) but text rendering proved unreliable across several attempts
  (see commit history `caa8325`..`9c6c202`). The project switched to driving Minecraft's
  built-in XP/level bar via `ServerPlayerEntity.setExperienceLevel(...)` instead of a custom
  HUD. If a custom HUD is revisited, research the correct 1.21.11 text-drawing API
  (`DrawContext` methods) before reattempting — this is exactly the kind of thing this doc
  should have caught earlier.

## Open questions

- What is the correct, current way to fully suppress vanilla XP orb drops/pickup in 1.21.11
  without fighting the vanilla XP bar (Fischey's in-progress work on `fischey_workbranch`)?
  Needs a verified Mixin target method + confirmation it doesn't break unrelated vanilla
  mechanics (anvils, enchanting tables, which also read player XP).

## Player data / attributes (researched for the Class System, 2026-07-04)

Verified against the actual jars in `~/.gradle/caches/` (fabric-api sources jar for the
Attachment API's own package, which is unmapped/stable regardless of Yarn; the Yarn
1.21.11+build.6 `mappings.tiny` for vanilla class/method names) — not from training data,
since this exact question was previously flagged as an open unknown.

**Persistence answer: use Fabric's Attachment API (`fabric-data-attachment-api-v1`), not a
custom NBT mixin.** It's present in this project's Fabric API version
(`0.141.4+1.21.11` pulls it in as a submodule — confirmed via
`net.fabricmc.fabric.api.attachment.v1.*` in the Gradle module cache). This resolves the
`PlayerProgressData.writeNbt`/`readNbt`-never-called gap noted above, and is the pattern the
Class System's class-selection data now uses too:

```java
public interface AttachmentTarget { // implemented via mixin on Entity, BlockEntity, ServerLevel, ChunkAccess
    <A> A getAttached(AttachmentType<A> type);
    <A> A setAttached(AttachmentType<A> type, A value);
    <A> A getAttachedOrCreate(AttachmentType<A> type, Supplier<A> initializer);
    boolean hasAttached(AttachmentType<?> type);
}
```

Register once via `AttachmentRegistry.createPersistent(Identifier id, Codec<A> codec)` (or
`.create(id, builder -> ...)` for finer control — e.g. `.copyOnDeath()`, or `.syncWith(...)`
if the client also needs to know the value). `ServerPlayerEntity` (an `Entity`) gets
`getAttached`/`setAttached` for free via Fabric's mixin — no custom NBT read/write code
needed, no join-time re-sync boilerplate like the progression system's tick-based XP sync
required. Persistent attachments survive relogin and server restart automatically.

**Passive stat bonuses: use `EntityAttributeModifier` with a stable `Identifier`, added via
`LivingEntity.getAttributeInstance(EntityAttribute).addPersistentModifier(...)`.** Confirmed
via Yarn 1.21.11 mappings (`mappings.tiny`, class `ciq` = `EntityAttributeModifier`, class
`cio` = `EntityAttributeInstance`):

- `EntityAttributeModifier(Identifier id, double value, EntityAttributeModifier.Operation operation)`
  — **`Identifier`, not `UUID`** (the API changed away from UUID-keyed modifiers in recent
  versions; don't reach for the older UUID constructor from stale tutorials/training data).
- `LivingEntity.getAttributeInstance(EntityAttribute type)` → `EntityAttributeInstance`
  (works on `ServerPlayerEntity` since it extends `LivingEntity`).
- On the instance: `addPersistentModifier(modifier)` (serialized with the entity — survives
  relogin/restart on its own, same guarantee as vanilla equipment/potion attribute
  modifiers) vs. `addTemporaryModifier(modifier)` (not serialized). Also:
  `hasModifier(Identifier id)`, `getModifier(Identifier id)`, `removeModifier(Identifier id)`
  / `removeModifier(EntityAttributeModifier)`, `overwritePersistentModifier(modifier)`.
- Practical pattern for a class system: give each class's bonus(es) a fixed
  `Identifier` (e.g. `baum2:class_bonus/eisenwaechter_max_health`). On class
  (re)selection, `removeModifier(oldId)` for the previous class's modifier ids, then
  `addPersistentModifier(new EntityAttributeModifier(newId, value, operation))` for the new
  class. Because it's persistent, **no per-tick or per-join reapplication is needed** (unlike
  the progression system's XP bar, which needed a custom S2C packet every tick because
  vanilla only pushes XP to the client on specific server calls) — this is vanilla-native
  entity state, not something we're re-deriving each tick.

**No built-in "class" concept exists in vanilla or Fabric API** — confirmed nothing like it
in the attachment/attribute APIs above. The `classes/` package (`PlayerClass`,
`ClassRegistry`, `ClassDefinition`, `ClassManager`) is entirely custom game logic backed by
our own registry, per the `MASTERPROMPT.md` architecture sketch — there's no existing engine
concept to hook into or misuse instead.

## Open questions

- Persistence: `PlayerProgressData` already has `writeNbt`/`readNbt` but nothing calls them
  yet — need to confirm the correct 1.21.11 hook for per-player persistent data (Fabric's
  attachment API vs. classic `PlayerEntity` NBT read/write mixin) before implementing.
  **Partially answered above**: the Attachment API is confirmed as the right tool in
  general. Whether to migrate `PlayerProgressData` itself onto it (replacing the in-memory
  `HashMap` in `PlayerLevelSystem`) is a separate decision for whoever next works on
  progression persistence — not done as part of the Class System work, to avoid touching
  files Fischey is actively iterating on.
